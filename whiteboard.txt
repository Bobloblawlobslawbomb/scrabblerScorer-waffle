Make a console application that takes a word and returns the Scrabble score for that word. 

Make sure to start with your specs, and that you include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it. 

Here are the values of letters in Scrabble:

A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10

quirky
 = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 22

Key Arrays: //would each be a list? think about it.


For the letters:
1) a database of the letter values
worthOne = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "l", "n", "r", "s", "t"];
worthTwo = ["d", "g"];
worthThree = ["b", "c", "m", "p"];
worthFour = ["f", "h", "v", "w", "y"];
worthFive = ["k"];
worthEight = ["j", "x"];
worthTen = ["q", "z"];

For the words:
1) needs to take a word
2) needs to break the word into a character array  
3) determine all the values of the letters added together
4) give back a score
